My final year project is a Scala Android application. The source code
for the project can be located in \project\Client\testproject\src\main\scala\my\android\project.

To execute the tests for this program open a terminal window and browser to the top testproject directory. 
From here start SBT and compile the program. To switch to the test subproject enter "project tests". 

To run the tests from the tests project first compile the application using the command "compile". After
this enter the "test" command to run the tests.
